# Online_Organic_Store

This application utilizes React, HTML, CSS, and Javascript for the front-end, and Python, Flask, and MongoDB for the back-end.
Users can navigate to the catalog which auto-populates all of the different items available in this store. Administrators can even create new products or add discount codes.
There's also a cart feature that remembers how many and which products are selected.
